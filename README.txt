Before running the project please make sure
you have the beautifulsoup4 and requests modules installed.
Also when you run the project your first input should be like this;
*website: https://www.tagesspiegel.de/ ==> you have to enter just like this.
also when it asks you about root folder, i created it on the desktop all the time.
like; C:\Users\user\Desktop. enter this and a folder tagesspiegel will appaer.

Have a nice day.
